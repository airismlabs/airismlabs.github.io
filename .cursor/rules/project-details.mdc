company description: We build tools that help users make sense of their AI conversations. Our core offerings include Kit, a powerful library designed to parse, structure, and organize exports from ChatGPT and Claude, and Studio, an intuitive web app for visualizing and exploring those exports. Together, Kit and Studio empower users to turn messy AI transcripts into searchable, structured knowledge, making AI-assisted work more navigable, transparent, and actionable.
