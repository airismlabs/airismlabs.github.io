## Our Mission: Make AI Outputs Human-Readable

We believe that the conversations you have with AI assistants contain valuable insights, patterns, and knowledge that shouldn't be trapped in messy export files. Our mission is to build tools that unlock this value and make AI interaction data as useful as the conversations themselves.

## Our Story: From Messy Exports to Clarity

### The Problem We Faced

It started with a simple frustration: one of our researchers had months of ChatGPT conversations about their PhD research, but the export file was a 50MB JSON mess that was impossible to navigate or analyze.

### The "Aha" Moment

We realized this wasn't just a personal problem‚Äîanyone using AI assistants for serious work eventually hits the same wall. Your AI conversations become a valuable knowledge base, but there's no good way to explore, search, or learn from them.

### Building the Solution

We started with a simple parser for ChatGPT exports. Then Claude. Then we built visualization tools. Before we knew it, we had the foundation for something bigger: a complete toolkit for AI conversation analysis.

### Today and Tomorrow

Today, Airism helps researchers, teams, and individuals unlock insights from their AI conversations. Tomorrow, we're building toward a future where your AI interaction history becomes as valuable and searchable as your email, documents, or notes.

## Community Values and Contributions
