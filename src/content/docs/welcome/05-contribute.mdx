### Getting Started with Development

1. **Fork the repository** you want to contribute to
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Install dependencies** with `npm install`
4. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
5. **Make your changes** with tests
6. **Submit a pull request** for review

## Guidelines

### Code Style

We use consistent formatting across all repositories:

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with comprehensive type definitions
- **Prettier**: Automatic code formatting (run `npm run format`)
- **ESLint**: Linting rules for code quality (run `npm run lint`)
- **Tests**: Required for new features (run `npm test`)

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
# Good commit messages
feat(kit): add support for Claude Pro exports
fix(studio): resolve timeline rendering bug
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(parsers): add edge case tests for ChatGPT format
```

### Documentation Standards

- **Clear Examples**: Every feature needs working code examples
- **User-Focused**: Write for the person trying to solve a problem
- **Keep Updated**: Update docs when changing functionality
- **Test Instructions**: Verify all examples actually work

### Issue Triage

We use labels to organize issues:

- `bug` - Something isn't working correctly
- `feature` - New functionality request
- `docs` - Documentation improvement
- `good first issue` - Beginner-friendly tasks
- `help wanted` - Community input needed
- `parser` - Related to data parsing
- `studio` - Related to the web application
- `kit` - Related to the library
