## The Problem with Raw AI Exports

If you've ever tried to work with AI conversation exports, you know the pain:

### Common Pain Points

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Messy JSON Structure" icon="warning">
    Raw exports are nested, inconsistent, and hard to parse. ChatGPT and Claude use completely different formats.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Cross-Session Insight" icon="puzzle">
    Each conversation exists in isolation. Finding patterns across months of interactions is nearly impossible.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limited Search" icon="magnifier">
    Basic text search through thousands of messages is slow and inflexible. No semantic understanding.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Metadata" icon="information">
    Timestamps are inconsistent, system prompts are buried, and conversation context is lost.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Airism's Approach: Parse Once, Explore Endlessly

We believe your AI conversations contain valuable insights that shouldn't be locked away in messy export files.

### Our Philosophy

**Normalize First**: Convert all AI exports into a consistent, type-safe format that's easy to work with.

**Preserve Everything**: Maintain full conversation context, metadata, and relationships between messages.

**Enable Exploration**: Provide tools for search, visualization, and analysis that scale from single conversations to massive datasets.

## How Kit and Studio Work Together

### The Perfect Workflow

1. **Extract** → Use Kit to parse raw exports into clean, structured data
2. **Enhance** → Kit normalizes timestamps, extracts metadata, and identifies conversation patterns  
3. **Explore** → Studio visualizes your data with timelines, search, and advanced filtering
4. **Analyze** → Use Studio's insights to understand your AI usage patterns
5. **Export** → Take enhanced data back to your own tools in multiple formats

### For Different Use Cases

## Open-Source, Modular, and Extensible

### Why Open Source?

- **Transparency**: See exactly how your data is processed
- **Security**: Run everything locally if needed
- **Community**: Benefit from contributions and extensions
- **Longevity**: Never worry about vendor lock-in

### Modular Design

Airism Kit is built with composability in mind:

```typescript
// Use just what you need
import { parseChatGPT, normalizeTimestamps } from '@airism/kit'

// Extend with custom parsers
import { createCustomParser } from '@airism/kit/extend'
```

### Growing Ecosystem

While we started with ChatGPT and Claude, our architecture supports:

- **Future AI Platforms**: Easy to add new parsers
- **Custom Formats**: Build your own parsers with our toolkit
- **Export Targets**: Multiple output formats for different use cases
- **Plugin System**: Community extensions for specialized needs
